# CODE2CAREER_HARSHA
Project Aim - developing a Lightweight TFTP Implementation for Embedded Systems.

Project Goals:

1. Minimalistic TFTP Server/Client: Conserve resources for systems with limited memory and processing power.
2. RTOS and Embedded Linux Compatibility: Versatile support for common platforms.
3. Core TFTP Operations: Implement RRQ, WRQ, DATA, ACK, and ERROR functions.
